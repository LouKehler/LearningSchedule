PHP code to generate a learning schedule for use with Aleph with Beth and Alpha with Angela materials
with a HTML/JS front-end to allow the user to choose between courses, the language, and the maximum 
length of each lesson (30, 60, or 90 minutes). The PHP generates the lesson plan in HTML with active links
to the videos and quizzes and boxes to check off progress if printed. Currently, English, French, Portuguese
and Spanish are supported in both the lesson plan and the web page front-end.
